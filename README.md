Stopwatch
=========

This is my first iOS app as I follow along in [this Udemy course](
  https://www.udemy.com/complete-ios-developer-course/?dtcode=QgCngwE2HrCM
). It is a very simple stopwatch that starts, stops, and resets. Furthermore,
it is fully tested. The real learning experience in this app was understanding
iOS enough to write thorough tests.
